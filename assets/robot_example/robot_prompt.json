    "prompt": "The video is a demonstration of robotic manipulation, likely in a laboratory or testing environment. It features two robotic arms interacting with a piece of blue fabric. The setting is a room with a beige couch in the background, providing a neutral backdrop for the robotic activity. The robotic arms are positioned on either side of the fabric, which is placed on a yellow cushion. The left robotic arm is white with a black gripper, while the right arm is black with a more complex, articulated gripper. At the beginning, the fabric is laid out on the cushion. The left robotic arm approaches the fabric, its gripper opening and closing as it positions itself. The right arm remains stationary initially, poised to assist. As the video progresses, the left arm grips the fabric, lifting it slightly off the cushion. The right arm then moves in, its gripper adjusting to grasp the opposite side of the fabric. Both arms work in coordination, lifting and holding the fabric between them. The fabric is manipulated with precision, showcasing the dexterity and control of the robotic arms. The camera remains static throughout, focusing on the interaction between the robotic arms and the fabric, allowing viewers to observe the detailed movements and coordination involved in the task.",
    "negative_prompt": "The video captures a game playing, with bad crappy graphics and cartoonish frames. It represents a recording of old outdated games. The lighting looks very fake. The textures are very raw and basic. The geometries are very primitive. The images are very pixelated and of poor CG quality. There are many subtitles in the footage. Overall, the video is unrealistic at all."
